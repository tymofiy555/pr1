Why you think that íbout nude
íCause your viewís so rude
Think outside the box
Then youíll like it
 
Hello my name is Yeppi Yeppi
Slightly dumb the way I talk, but Iíve got sexy, sexy figure
Well, for a tiara with a diamond
Did you think Iíd just laugh as if, laugh as if
 
Twisted Lorelei that Donít need no man
A bookworm obsessed with philosophy, a Self-made woman
Very flabbergasted by this sassy Story
Audience booing and shouting ìYou tricked me youíre a liarî
 
Ah an undressed Movie star
Ah a night of broken starlight
Even if I look tacky or fall apart
Even if Iím not loved anymore
 
Yes Iím a nude
Nude Dda-dda-lat-dda-ra
Yes Iím a nude
Nude I donít give a love
 
Baby how do I look, how do I look
Put on my beautiful self and Dda-dda-lat-dda-ra
Baby how do I look, how do I look
Put on my beautiful self and Dda-dda-lat-dda-ra
 
(Ouch!)
Excusez-moi, to all of you who are sitting here
If you were expecting some rated R show
Oh Iím sorry, but thatís not what weíre showing
For Refund, see that direction, whatever people say is not my interest
Youíre welcome to throw those popcorns
Rating is just the inverse of bliss
But my climax, I feel sick of those prejudice made by themselves
 
Ah an undressed Movie star
Ah no more shameless night
Even if I look tacky or perhaps to you
Even if Iím not loved anymore
 
Yes Iím a nude
Nude Dda-dda-lat-dda-ra
Yes Iím a nude
Nude I donít give a love
 
Baby how do I look, how do I look
Put on my beautiful self and Dda-dda-lat-dda-ra
Baby how do I look, how do I look
Put on my beautiful self and Dda-dda-lat-dda-ra
 
Um ha um ha um ha um
Yes Iím a nude
Yes Iím a nude
Now I draw a luxury nude
 
Why you think that íbout nude
íCause your viewís so rude
Think outside the box
Speak out
 
My beautiful self
My beautiful self
Iím born nude
Youíve got a dirty mind
 
Rude
